# Code Refactor Starter Code

# Horiseon strategies
The following are changes implemented to the index.html and style.css style sheets.

* Changed the title from website to Horiseon.

* Switched from div to section in lines 11, 26, 28, 50, 51, and 73. To separate each of the sections better.

* Used "search-online-social" for every href, id, and class under section class="header" and section class="content" in the index.html style sheet.

* Inserted .search-online-social to the style.css style sheet to compact the style.css style sheet. Which also made all of the links function properly. 

* Used "benefit-section" for every class under section class="benefits" in the index.html style sheet.

* Inserted .benefit-section to compact the style.css style sheet.

* Deleted unecessary code on the style.css style sheet.

* Organized style.css style sheet code in order of index.html.

* Added comments to help organize the style.css style sheet.
